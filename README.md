# Military-Academy
Design and implement a program in C++ that informs the user of the acceptance status of each candidate applying based on the qualifications stated above. The user will input a group of candidates at a time. For each candidate, they will provide sex, height & weight (The gender should be read into a single character variable). Each of the input values should be error-checked. For each candidate, the program will output whether each candidate was accepted, or rejected based on height, weight, or height & weight. The user will input ‘X’ or ‘x’ for the gender when they are finished entering in all the applicants. The program will output the number of candidates accepted and the percentage of candidates accepted.
